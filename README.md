# Presentation
This repository contains the code of **DISIR**: Deep Image Segmentation with Interactive Refinement. In a nutshell, it consists in neural networks trained to perform semantic segmentation with human guidance. You may refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14200) for detailed explanations.

 This repository is divided into two parts:
 - `train` which contains the training code of the networks ([README](./train/README.md))
 - `qgs_plugin` which contains the code of the QGIS plugin used to perform the interactive segmentation ([README](./qgis_plugin/README.md))

# Install Python dependencies

```
conda create -n disir python=3.7 rtree gdal=2.4 opencv scipy shapely -c 'conda-forge' 
conda activate disir
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 # To use
 Please note that this repository has been tested on Ubuntu 18.4, QGIS 3.8 and python 3.7 only.

1. Download a segmentation dataset such as [ISPRS Potsdam](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/data-request-form2.html) or [INRIA dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/download/).
2. Prepare this dataset according to `Dataset preprocessing` in `train/README.md`.
3. Train a model and convert it to a torch script still following `train/README.md`.
4. Install the [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) plugin following `qgs_plugin/README.md`.
5. Follow `How to start` in `qgs_plugin/README.md` and start segmenting your data !
